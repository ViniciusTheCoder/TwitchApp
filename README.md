# TwitchApp 📱

- Status: Developed ✅

- This is a challenge from Rocketseat Ignite React-Native trail
- Here I basically used Twitch API to practice oAuth skills

## Features
- Currently you already can clone this respository and login with ur account
- Twitch API makes it possible a lot of things that I haven't tested yet, though as I advance my studis, I really want to add more functions in this application 🤞

## Advices ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- This application uses the oAuth twitch API function, so if u wanna build ur own app with the same features, must read the documentation e create your own URI, if you don't, won't get right

## How to run 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️

In root folder, run: 

Start bundle:

```javascript
expo start
```

## Some add commands

Install dependencies: 

```javascript
yarn
```

```javascript
expo install
```
